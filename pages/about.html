                  <h2>Statement of Purpose</h2>
                  <p>In the digital age, individuals should feel empowered to leverage technology tools to fully participate in society and connect with critical resources, such as healthcare benefits, employment opportunities, and educational resources. Grassroots solutions are crucial to expand digital inclusion and connect communities with technological infrastructure, resources, and skills. With artificial intelligence (AI) transforming the way that companies, online spaces, and government operate, it is essential for community members to gain AI fluency. AI fluency is no longer optional, but a core part of digital inclusion. Without integrating AI fluency into digital inclusion curriculum, AI will exacerbate the digital divide, resulting in the "AI divide."</p>
                  <h2>Why demystifyAI Chicago?</h2>
                  <p>Equipping individuals with AI readiness skills empowers them to engage more confidently in AI-related conversations, recognize and challenge abuses of AI in both personal and civic contexts, and explore how AI can be meaningfully integrated into their personal and professional lives. This task is nonpartisan: technology should not happen TO individuals but rather FOR individuals. Digital literacy efforts already exist in Chicago, but many organizations do not have the resources to integrate AI curriculum into their programming. DemystifyAI fills this gap by providing community members with a practical AI readiness curriculum, which is especially important for nonprofits. Our curriculum is designed with the everyday community member in mind, foregrounding lived experiences and community input to co-create interesting, relevant, and impactful curriculum.</p>
                  <h2 id="mission">Our Mission</h2>
                  <p>Our mission is to equip Chicago community members with practical AI and digital literacy skills to participate confidently in our AI-integrated society while protecting themselves from AI-related risks. 
                    Our target audience – with emphasis on accessibility across income levels, ethnicities, languages, and digital experience levels – includes digital inclusion nonprofit organizations (and subsequently, the communities they serve), and community members whom we are able to reach ourselves. 
                    In order for demystifyAI Chicago to serve as many community members as possible, we will pursue two tracks:</p>
                  <ul class="tracks">
                      <li><strong>Track 1 (Nonprofit Co-Creation):</strong> Geared toward community members that different digital inclusion nonprofits already serve, allowing us to reach communities for whom we are not immediately accessible (e.g. due to language barriers).</li>
                      <li><strong>Track 2 (Direct Delivery):</strong> Direct content delivery to different community members.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The ultimate goal is to develop an open-source repository of resources that can be adapted to fit each community's needs.</p>
                  <h2>Syllabus</h2>
                  <p>demystifyAI Chicago leveraged existing online AI readiness resources to design a base AI literacy curriculum. 
                  We engage with community members primarily through Track 1, the nonprofit co-creation and "Train the Trainer" model, 
                  which involves tailoring the base curriculum to the partner organization's needs and co-designing with 
                  interested nonprofits/community organizations. We also provide training sessions for nonprofit staff, per interest, with the ultimate goal of our base curriculum being something the partner
                  organization can deliver independently. Each organization receives a stipend for working with us, to be used for training and outreach to community members. 
                  Track 2, the direct delivery mode, involves demystifyAI Chicago's team directly delivering the syllabus - in form of workshops - to interested community members. 
                  <p>Curriculum can be delivered in three parts or combined and modified given logistical constraints. 
                    We currently support the following modules, in addition to pre-session and post-session surveys.</p>
