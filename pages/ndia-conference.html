                <h2>Our Workshop</h2>
                <p><strong>Beyond One-Size-Fits-All: AI Literacy and Inclusion Across Different Communities</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Date & Time:</strong> February 3, 2026 | 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM</p>
                <p>The workshop will begin with a short introduction to discussions and debates around the role of AI literacy in digital inclusion curriculum, with participants engaging in think-pair-share activities to discuss their own anxieties and hopes for AI. Then, we will introduce "AI Foundations" from our curriculum to briefly explain the building blocks of AI and what community-led, participatory AI curriculum design looks like. For example, we will lead a guided activity where participants will identify the population they serve, the specific AI knowledge needs of that population, and which major themes would most resonate with their population (e.g. "AI Scam and Phishing Risks," "Know-Your Rights," "AI to Power Language Translation," "AI for Work"). After sharing with each other and analyzing similarities and differences across practitioners' communities, we will present best practices around designing and implementing AI literacy and readiness curriculum.</p>
