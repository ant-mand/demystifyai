        <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
        <p>
            Equipping individuals with AI readiness skills empowers them to 
            engage more confidently in AI-related conversations, recognize and challenge abuses of AI 
            in both personal and civic contexts, and explore how AI can be meaningfully integrated 
            into their personal and professional lives. 
            <br></br>
            We are students at the University of Chicago in Chicago, developing curriculum material for the everyday community member 
            to build basic-intermediate AI literacy, foregrounding lived experiences and community input to co-create interesting, relevant, and impactful curriculum.
